Server How To
=============

Setting Up a Koji Build System
==============================

The Koji components may **live** on separate resources as long as all resources
are able to communicate. This document will cover how to setup each service
individually, however, all services may **live** on the same resource.

Knowledge Prerequisites
=======================

* Basic understanding of SSL and authentication via certificates and/or
  Kerberos credentials
* Basic knowledge about creating a database in PostgreSQL and importing a schema
* Working with psql
* Basic knowledge about Apache configuration
* Basic knowledge about `dnf`_/`yum`_/`createrepo`_/`mock`_ - else you'll not
  be able to debug problems!
* Basic knowledge about using command line
* Basic knowledge about RPM building
* Simple usage of the Koji client
* For an overview of yum, mock, Koji (and all its subcomponents), mash, and how
  they all work together, see the excellent slides put together by `Steve
  Traylen at CERN <http://indico.cern.ch/event/55091>`_.

Package Prerequisites
=====================

On the server (koji-hub/koji-web)
---------------------------------
* httpd
* mod_ssl
* postgresql-server
* mod_wsgi

On the builder (koji-builder)
-----------------------------
* mock
* setarch (for some archs you'll require a patched version)
* rpm-build
* createrepo

A note on filesystem space
==========================
Koji will consume copious amounts of disk space under the primary KojiDir
directory (as set in the kojihub.conf file - defaults to ``/mnt/koji``).
However, as koji makes use of mock on the backend to actually create build
roots and perform the builds in those build roots, it might come to a surprise
to users that a running koji server will consume large amounts of disk space
under ``/var/lib/mock`` and ``/var/cache/mock`` as well. Users should either
plan the disk and filesystem allocations for this, or plan to modify the
default mock build directory in the kojid.conf file. If you change the
location, ensure that the new directories are owned by the group "mock" and
have 02755 permission.

Koji Authentication Selection
=============================
Koji primarily supports Kerberos and SSL Certificate authentication. For basic
koji command line access, plain user/pass combinations are possible.  However,
kojiweb does **not** support plain user/pass authentication and once either
Kerberos or SSL Certificate authentication is enabled for kojiweb, the plain
user/pass method will stop working entirely.  For this reason we encourage
skipping the plain user/pass method altogether and properly configuring either
Kerberos or SSL Certification authentication from the start.

The decision on how to authenticate users will affect all other actions you
take in setting up koji. For this reason it is a decision best made up front.

For Kerberos authentication
    a working Kerberos environment (the user is assumed to either already have
    this or know how to set it up themselves, instructions for it are not
    included here) and the Kerberos credentials of the initial admin user will
    be necessary to bootstrap the user database.

For SSL authentication
    SSL certificates for the xmlrpc server, for the various koji components,
    and one for the admin user will need to be setup (the user need not know
    how to create certificate chains already, we include the instructions for
    this below).

Setting up SSL Certificates for authentication
----------------------------------------------

Certificate generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create the ``/etc/pki/koji`` directory and copy-and-paste the ssl.cnf listed
here, and save it in the new directory. This configuration file is used along
with the ``openssl`` command to generate the SSL certificates for the various
koji components.

``ssl.cnf``

    authorityKeyIdentifier          = keyid:always,issuer:always
    basicConstraints                = CA:true

Although it is not required, it is recommended that you edit the default values
in the ``[req_distinguished_name]`` section of the configuration to match the
information for your own server. This will allow you to accept most of the
default values when generating certificates later. The other sections can be
left unedited.

Generate CA
^^^^^^^^^^^

The CA is the Certificate Authority.  It's the key/cert pair used to sign all
the other certificate requests.  When configuring the various koji components,
both the client CA and the server CA will be a copy of the CA generated here.
The CA certificate will be placed in the ``/etc/pki/koji`` directory and the
certificates for the other components will be placed in the
``/etc/pki/koji/certs`` directory. The ``index.txt`` file which is created is
a database of the certificates generated and can be used to view the
information for any of the certificates simply by viewing the contents of
``index.txt``.

::

    cd /etc/pki/koji/
    mkdir {certs,private,confs}
    touch index.txt
    echo 01 > serial
    openssl genrsa -out private/koji_ca_cert.key 2048
    openssl req -config ssl.cnf -new -x509 -days 3650 -key private/koji_ca_cert.key \
    -out koji_ca_cert.crt -extensions v3_ca

The last command above will ask you to confirm a number of items about the
certificate you are generating. Presumably you already edited the defaults for
the country, state/province, locale, and organization in the ``ssl.cnf`` file
and you only needed to hit enter. It's the organizational unit and the common
name that we will be changing in the various certs we create. For the CA
itself, these fields don't have a hard requirement. One suggestion for this
certificate is to use the FQDN of the server.

If you are trying to automate this process via a configuration management
tool, you can create the cert in one command with a line like this:

::

    openssl req -config ssl.cnf -new -x509 \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Portland/O=IT/CN=koji.example.com" \
    -days 3650 -key private/koji_ca_cert.key -out koji_ca_cert.crt -extensions v3_ca

Generate the koji component certificates and the admin certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each koji component needs its own certificate to identify it. Two of the
certificates (kojihub and kojiweb) are used as server side certificates that
authenticate the server to the client. For this reason, you want the common
name on both of those certs to be the fully qualified domain name of the web
server they are running on so that clients don't complain about the common
name and the server not being the same. You can set the OU for these two
certificates to be kojihub and kojiweb for identification purposes.

For the other certificates (kojira, kojid, the initial admin account, and all
user certificates), the cert is used to authenticate the client to the server.
The common name for these certs should be set to the login name for that
specific component. For example the common name for the kojira cert should be
set to kojira so that it matches the username. The reason for this is that the
common name of the cert will be matched to the corresponding user name in the
koji database. If there is not a username in the database which matches the CN
of the cert the client will not be authenticated and access will be denied.

When you later use ``koji add-host`` to add a build machine into the koji
database, it creates a user account for that host even though the user account
doesn't appear in the user list.  The user account created must match the
common name of the certificate which that component uses to authenticate with
the server. When creating the kojiweb certificate, you'll want to remember
exactly what values you enter for each field as you'll have to regurgitate
those into the /etc/koji-hub/hub.conf file as the ProxyDNs entry.

When you need to create multiple certificates it may be convenient to create a
loop or a script like the on listed below and run the script to create the
certificates. You can simply adjust the number of kojibuilders and the name of
the admin account as you see fit. For much of this guide, the admin account is
called ``kojiadmin``.

::

    #!/bin/bash
    # if you change your certificate authority name to something else you will
    # need to change the caname value to reflect the change.
    caname=koji

    # user is equal to parameter one or the first argument when you actually
    # run the script
    user=$1

    openssl genrsa -out private/${user}.key 2048
    cat ssl.cnf | sed 's/insert_hostname/'${user}'/'> ssl2.cnf
    openssl req -config ssl2.cnf -new -nodes -out certs/${user}.csr -key private/${user}.key
    openssl ca -config ssl2.cnf -keyfile private/${caname}_ca_cert.key -cert ${caname}_ca_cert.crt \
        -out certs/${user}.crt -outdir certs -infiles certs/${user}.csr
    cat certs/${user}.crt private/${user}.key > ${user}.pem
    mv ssl2.cnf confs/${user}-ssl.cnf

Generate a PKCS12 user certificate (for web browser)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is only required for user certificates.

::

    openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey private/${user}.key -in certs/${user}.crt \
        -CAfile ${caname}_ca_cert.crt -out certs/${user}_browser_cert.p12

When generating certs for a user, the user will need the ``${user}.pem``, the
``${caname}_ca_cert.crt``, and the ``${user}_browser_cert.p12`` files which
were generated above.  The ${user}.pem file would normally be installed as
``~/.fedora.cert``, the ``${caname}_ca_cert.crt`` file would be installed as
both ``~/.fedora-upload-ca.cert`` and ``~/.fedora-server-ca.cert``, and the
user would import the ``${user}_brower_cert.p12`` into their web browser as a
personal certificate.

Copy certificates into ~/.koji for kojiadmin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You're going to want to be able to send admin commands to the kojihub. In order
to do so, you'll need to use the newly created certificates to authenticate
with the hub. Create the kojiadmin user then copy the certificates for the koji
CA and the kojiadmin user to ``~/.koji``:

::

    kojiadmin@localhost$ mkdir ~/.koji
    kojiadmin@localhost$ cp /etc/pki/koji/kojiadmin.pem ~/.koji/client.crt   # NOTE: It is IMPORTANT you use the PEM and NOT the CRT
    kojiadmin@localhost$ cp /etc/pki/koji/koji_ca_cert.crt ~/.koji/clientca.crt
    kojiadmin@localhost$ cp /etc/pki/koji/koji_ca_cert.crt ~/.koji/serverca.crt

.. note::
    See /etc/koji.conf for the current system wide koji client configuration.
    Copy /etc/koji.conf to ~/.koji/config if you wish to change the config on a
    per user basis.

Setting up Kerberos for authentication
--------------------------------------

The initial configuration of a kerberos service is outside the scope of this
document, however there are a few specific things required by koji.

DNS
^^^

The koji builders (kojid) use DNS to find the kerberos servers for any given
realm.

::

    _kerberos._udp    IN SRV  10 100 88 kerberos.EXAMPLE.COM.

The trailing dot denotes DNS root and is needed if FQDN is used.


Principals and Keytabs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It should be noted that in general you will need to use the fully qualified
domain name of the hosts when generating the keytabs for services.

You will need the following principals extracted to a keytab for a fully
kerberized configuration, the requirement for a host key for the koji-hub is
currently hard coded into the koji client.

``host/kojihub@EXAMPLE.COM``
    Used by the koji-hub server when communicating with the koji client

``HTTP/kojiweb@EXAMPLE.COM``
    Used by the koji-web server when performing a negotiated Kerberos
    authentication with a web browser. This is a service principal for
    Apache's mod_auth_gssapi.

``koji/kojiweb@EXAMPLE.COM``
    Used by the koji-web server during communications with the koji-hub. This
    is a user principal that will authenticate koji-web to Kerberos as
    "koji/kojiweb@EXAMPLE.COM". Koji-web will proxy the mod_auth_gssapi user
    information to koji-hub (the ``ProxyPrincipals`` koji-hub config
    option).

``koji/kojira@EXAMPLE.COM``
    Used by the kojira server during communications with the koji-hub

``compile/builder1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM``
    Used on builder1 to communicate with the koji-hub. This
    is a user principal that will authenticate koji-builder to Kerberos as
    "compile/builder1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM". Each builder host will have
    its own unique Kerberos user principal to authenticate to the hub.

PostgreSQL Server
=================

Once the authentication scheme has been setup your will need to install and
configure a PostgreSQL server and prime the database which will be used to hold
the koji users.

Configuration Files
-------------------

* ``/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf``
* ``/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf``

Install PostgreSQL
------------------

Install the ``postgresql-server`` package::

    # yum install postgresql-server

Initialize PostgreSQL DB:
-------------------------

Initialize PostgreSQL::

    # On RHEL 7:
    root@localhost$ postgresql-setup initdb

    # Or RHEL 8 and Fedora:
    root@localhost$ postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql

And start the database service::

    root@localhost$ systemctl enable postgresql --now

Setup User Accounts:
--------------------

The following commands will setup the ``koji`` account and assign it a password

::

    root@localhost$ useradd koji
    root@localhost$ passwd koji

Setup PostgreSQL and populate schema:
-------------------------------------

The following commands will:

* create the koji user within PostgreSQL
* create the koji database within PostgreSQL
* set a password for the koji user
* create the koji schema using the provided
  ``/usr/share/doc/koji*/docs/schema.sql`` file from the ``koji`` package.

::

    root@localhost$ su - postgres
    postgres@localhost$ createuser --no-superuser --no-createrole --no-createdb koji
    postgres@localhost$ createdb -O koji koji
    postgres@localhost$ psql -c "alter user koji with encrypted password 'mypassword';"
    postgres@localhost$ logout
    root@localhost$ yum -y install koji
    root@localhost$ su - koji
    koji@localhost$ psql koji koji < /usr/share/doc/koji*/docs/schema.sql
    koji@localhost$ exit

.. note::
    When issuing the command to import the psql schema into the new database it
    is important to ensure that the directory path
    /usr/share/doc/koji*/docs/schema.sql remains intact and is not resolved to
    a specific version of koji. In test it was discovered that when the path is
    resolved to a specific version of koji then not all of the tables were
    created correctly.

.. note::
    When issuing the command to import the psql schema into the new database it
    is important to ensure that you are logged in as the koji database owner.
    This will ensure all objects are owned by the koji database user. Upgrades
    may be difficult if this was not done correctly.

Authorize Koji-hub to PostgreSQL
--------------------------------

Koji-hub is the only service that needs direct access to the database. Every
other Koji service talks with the koji-hub via the API calls.

Example: Everything on localhost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, the koji-hub Apache server is running on the same system
as the PostgreSQL server, so we can use local-only connections over a Unix
domain socket.

#. Edit ``/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`` to have the following
   contents::

       #TYPE   DATABASE    USER    CIDR-ADDRESS      METHOD
       local   koji        koji                       trust
       local   all         postgres                   peer

   Explanation:

   * The ``local`` connection type means the postgres connection uses a local
     Unix socket, so PostgreSQL is not exposed over TCP/IP at all.

   * The local ``koji`` user should only have access to the ``koji`` database.
     The local ``postgres`` user will have access to everything (in order to
     create the ``koji`` database and user.)

   * The ``CIDR-ADDRESS`` column is blank, because this example only uses
     local Unix sockets.

   * The `trust <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-trust.html>`_
     method means that PosgreSQL will permit any connections from any local
     user for this username. We set this for the ``koji`` user because Apache
     httpd runs as the ``apache`` system user rather than the ``koji`` user
     when it connects to the Unix socket. ``trust`` is not secure on a
     multi-user system, but it is fine for a single-purpose Koji system.

     The `peer <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-peer.html>`_
     method means that PostgreSQL will obtain the client's operating system
     username and use that as the allowed username. This is safer than
     ``trust`` because only the local ``postgres`` system user will be able to
     access PostgreSQL with this level of access.

#. Edit ``/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf`` and set ``listen_addresses``
   to prevent TCP/IP access entirely::

       listen_addresses = ''

Example: Separate PostgreSQL and Apache servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, the PostgreSQL server "db.example.com" is running on one
host, and the koji-hub Apache server talks to this PostgreSQL server over the
network. The koji-hub Apache server has an IP address of 192.0.2.1 (IPv4) and
2001:db8::1 (IPv6), so we authorize connections from both addresses for the
``koji`` user account.

#. Edit ``/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`` to have the following contents::

       #TYPE   DATABASE    USER    CIDR-ADDRESS      METHOD
       host    koji        koji    192.0.2.1/32       md5
       host    koji        koji    2001:db8::1/128    md5
       local   all         postgres                   peer

   The ``md5`` authentication mechanism is available in PostgreSQL 9 (RHEL 7).
   On PostgreSQL 10 (RHEL 8+ and Fedora), use the stronger ``scram-sha-256``
   mechanism instead, and set ``password_encryption = scram-sha-256`` in
   ``postgresql.conf``.

#. Edit ``/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf`` and set ``listen_addresses``
   so that PostgreSQL will listen on all network interfaces::

    listen_addresses = '*'

Activating changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You must reload the PostgreSQL daemon to activate changes to
``postgresql.conf`` or ``pg_hba.conf``::

    root@localhost$ systemctl reload postgresql

Bootstrapping the initial koji admin user into the PostgreSQL database
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You must add the initial admin user manually to the user database using sql
commands.  Once you have bootstrapped this initial admin user, you may add
additional users and change privileges of those users via the koji command
line tool.

However, if you decided to use the simple user/pass method of authentication,
then any password setting/changing must be done manually via sql commands as
there is no password manipulation support exposed through the koji tools.

The sql commands you need to use vary by authentication mechanism.

Maintaining database
--------------------

For now, there is one table which needs periodical cleanup. As postgres doesn't
have any mechanism for this, we need to do it via some other mechanism. Default
handling is done by cron, but can be substituted by anything else (Ansible
tower, etc.)

Script is by default installed on hub as `/usr/sbin/koji-sweep-db`.  It has also
corresponding `koji-sweep-db` service and timer. Note, that timer is not enabled
by default, so you need to run usual `systemctl` commands:

::

   systemctl enable --now koji-sweep-db.timer

If you don't want to use this script, be sure to run following SQL with
appropriate age setting. Default value of one day should be ok for most
deployments. As there will be tons of freed records, additional VACUUM can be
handy.

.. code-block:: sql

   DELETE FROM sessions WHERE update_time < NOW() - '1 day'::interval;
   VACUUM ANALYZE sessions;

Optionally (if you're using :ref:`reservation API <cg_api>` for
content generators), you could want to run also reservation cleanup:

.. code-block:: sql

   DELETE FROM build_reservations WHERE update_time < NOW() - '1 day'::interval;
   VACUUM ANALYZE build_reservations;

Set User/Password Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    root@localhost$ su - koji
    koji@localhost$ psql
    koji=> insert into users (name, password, status, usertype) values ('admin-user-name', 'admin-password-in-plain-text', 0, 0);

Kerberos authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The process is very similar to user/pass except you would replace the first
insert above with this:

::

    root@localhost$ su - koji
    koji@localhost$ psql <<EOF
    with user_id as (
    insert into users (name, status, usertype) values ('admin-user-name', 0, 0) returning id
    )
    insert into user_krb_principals (user_id, krb_principal) values (
    (select id from user_id),
    'admin@EXAMPLE');
    EOF

SSL Certificate authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is no need for either a password or a Kerberos principal, so this will
suffice:

::

    root@localhost$ su - koji
    koji@localhost$ psql
    koji=> insert into users (name, status, usertype) values ('admin-user-name', 0, 0);

Give yourself admin permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following command will give the user admin permissions. In order to do
this you will need to know the ID of the user.

::

    koji=> insert into user_perms (user_id, perm_id, creator_id) values (<id of user inserted above>, 1, <id of user inserted above>);

.. note::
    If you do not know the ID of the admin user, you can get the ID by running the query::

      koji=> select * from users;

You can't actually log in and perform any actions until kojihub is up and
running in your web server.  In order to get to that point you still need to
complete the authentication setup and the kojihub configuration. If you wish
to access koji via a web browser, you will also need to get kojiweb up and
running.

Koji Hub
========

Koji-hub is the center of all Koji operations. It is an XML-RPC server running
under mod_wsgi in the Apache httpd. koji-hub is passive in that it only
receives XML-RPC calls and relies upon the build daemons and other components
to initiate communication. Koji-hub is the only component that has direct
access to the database and is one of the two components that have write access
to the file system.

Configuration Files
-------------------

* ``/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf``
* ``/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf.d/*``
* ``/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf``
* ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/kojihub.conf``
* ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf`` (when using ssl auth)

Install koji-hub
----------------

Install the ``koji-hub`` package along with mod_ssl::

    # yum install koji-hub mod_ssl

Required Configuration
----------------------

We provide example configs for all services, so look for ``httpd.conf``, ``hub.conf``,
``kojiweb.conf`` and ``web.conf`` in source repo or related rpms.

/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The apache web server has two places that it sets maximum requests a server
will handle before the server restarts. The xmlrpc interface in kojihub is a
python application, and processes can sometimes grow outrageously large when it
doesn't reap memory often enough. As a result, it is strongly recommended that
you set both instances of ``MaxConnectionsPerChild`` in ``httpd.conf`` to
something reasonable in order to prevent the server from becoming overloaded
and crashing (at 100 the httpd processes will grow to about 75MB resident set
size before respawning).

::

    <IfModule prefork.c>
    ...
    MaxConnectionsPerChild  100
    </IfModule>
    <IfModule worker.c>
    ...
    MaxConnectionsPerChild  100
    </IfModule>
    <IfModule event.c>
    ...
    MaxRequestsPerChild  100
    </IfModule>

/etc/httpd/conf.d/kojihub.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The koji-hub package provides this configuration file. You will need to modify
it based on your authentication type. Instructions are contained within the
file and should be simple to follow.

For example, if you are using SSL authentication, you will want to uncomment
the section that looks like this:

::

    # uncomment this to enable authentication via SSL client certificates
    # <Location /kojihub/ssllogin>
    #         SSLVerifyClient require
    #         SSLVerifyDepth  10
    #         SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
    # </Location>


/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are configuring your server for httpd (and you really should), then your
``SSLCertificate*`` directives will generally live in the main ``ssl.conf`` file.
This part is mostly independent of Koji.
It's something you would do for any httpd instance.

The part that matters to Koji is this --
if you are using SSL authentication, then the CA certificate you configure
in ``SSLCACertificateFile`` here should be the same one that you use to issue
user certificates.

::

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/koji/certs/kojihub.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/koji/private/kojihub.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/pki/koji/koji_ca_cert.crt
    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/pki/koji/koji_ca_cert.crt


/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This file contains the configuration information for the hub. You will need to
edit this configuration to point Koji Hub to the database you are using and to
setup Koji Hub to utilize the authentication scheme you selected in the
beginning.

::

    DBName = koji
    DBUser = koji

    # If PostgreSQL is on another host, set that here:
    #DBHost = db.example.com
    #DBPass = mypassword

    KojiDir = /mnt/koji
    LoginCreatesUser = On
    KojiWebURL = http://kojiweb.example.com/koji

If koji-hub is running on the same server as PostgreSQL and you are using Unix
sockets to query the database, omit the ``DBHost``, ``DBPort``, and ``DBPass``
variables. Do not set ``DBHost`` to ``localhost``, or else PostgreSQL will
attempt to connect with TCP through ``127.0.0.1`` instead of using the Unix
socket.

If koji-hub is running on a separate server from PostgreSQL, you must set the
``DBHost`` and ``DBPass`` options. You must also configure SELinux to allow
Apache to connect to the remote PostgreSQL server::

    root@localhost$ setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db=1

Note, the database password (``DBPass`` parameter) is a sensitive value. The
``hub.conf`` file should have 0640 ``root``/``apache`` file permissions to
restrict access. If you're not installing the hub from RPM, double-check these
permissions.

Furthermore, you can install any config file in ``/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf.d``
directory. These files are read *at first* and main config is allowed to
override all these values. So, you can use e.g.
``/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf.d/secret.conf`` for sensitive values. Typical usecase
for separate config is :doc:`policy <defining_hub_policies>` configuration file.

Doc page about hub options in :doc:`Hub conf <hub_conf>`.

Authentication Configuration
----------------------------

/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If using Kerberos, these settings need to be valid and inline with other
services configurations.

::

    ProxyPrincipals = koji/kojiweb@EXAMPLE.COM
    HostPrincipalFormat = compile/%s@EXAMPLE.COM

If using SSL auth, these settings need to be valid and inline with other
services configurations for kojiweb to allow logins.

ProxyDNs should be set to the DN of the kojiweb certificate. For example::

    DNUsernameComponent = CN
    ProxyDNs = CN=example.com,OU=kojiweb,O=Example Org,ST=Massachusetts,C=US

Koji filesystem skeleton
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Above in the ``kojihub.conf`` file we set KojiDir to ``/mnt/koji``.  For
certain reasons, if you change this, you should make a symlink from
``/mnt/koji`` to the new location (note: this is a bug and should be fixed
eventually).  However, before other parts of koji will operate properly, we
need to create a skeleton filesystem structure for koji as well as make the
file area owned by apache so that the xmlrpc interface can write to it as
needed.

::

    cd /mnt
    mkdir koji
    cd koji
    mkdir {packages,repos,work,scratch,repos-dist}
    chown apache.apache *

SELinux Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure SELinux to allow Apache write access to ``/mnt/koji``::

    root@localhost$ setsebool -P allow_httpd_anon_write=1
    root@localhost$ semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t "/mnt/koji(/.*)?"
    root@localhost$ restorecon -r -v /mnt/koji

If you've placed ``/mnt/koji`` on an NFS share, enable a separate boolean to
allow Apache access to NFS::

    root@localhost$ setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs=1

Check Your Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point, you can now restart apache and you should have at least minimal
operation.  The admin user should be able to connect via the command line
client, add new users, etc.  It's possible at this time to undertake initial
administrative steps such as adding users and hosts to the koji database.

So we will need a working client to test with.

Koji cli - The standard client
==============================

The koji cli is the standard client. It can perform most tasks and is essential
to the successful use of any koji environment.

Ensure that your client is configured to work with your server. The system-wide
koji client configuration file is ``/etc/koji.conf``, and the user-specific one
is in ``~/.koji/config``. You may also use the ``-c`` option when using the
Koji client to specify an alternative configuration file.

If you are using SSL for authentication, you will need to edit the Koji client
configuration to tell it which URLs to use for the various Koji components and
where their SSL certificates can be found.

For a simple test, all we need is the ``server`` and authentication sections.

::

    [koji]

    ;url of XMLRPC server
    server = http://koji-hub.example.com/kojihub

    ;url of web interface
    weburl = http://koji-web.example.com/koji

    ;url of package download site
    topurl = http://koji-filesystem.example.com/kojifiles

    ;path to the koji top directory
    topdir = /mnt/koji

    ; configuration for SSL athentication

    ;client certificate
    cert = ~/.koji/client.crt

    ;certificate of the CA that issued the HTTP server certificate
    serverca = ~/.koji/serverca.crt

The following command will test your login to the hub:

::

    root@localhost$ koji moshimoshi

Koji Web - Interface for the Masses
===================================

Koji-web is a set of scripts that run in mod_wsgi and use the Cheetah
templating engine to provide an web interface to Koji. koji-web exposes a lot
of information and also provides a means for certain operations, such as
cancelling builds.

Configuration Files
-------------------

* ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/kojiweb.conf``
* ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf``
* ``/etc/kojiweb/web.conf``
* ``/etc/kojiweb/web.conf.d/*``

Install Koji-Web
----------------

Install the ``koji-web`` package along with mod_ssl::

    # yum install koji-web mod_ssl

Required Configuration
----------------------

/etc/httpd/conf.d/kojiweb.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The koji-web package provides this configuration file. You will need to modify
it based on your authentication type. Instructions are contained within the
file and should be simple to follow.

For example, if you are using SSL authentication, you would want to uncomment
the section that looks like this:

::

    # uncomment this to enable authentication via SSL client certificates
    # <Location /koji/login>
    #     SSLVerifyClient require
    #     SSLVerifyDepth  10
    #     SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
    # </Location>


/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly to the hub configuration, if you are using https (as you should),
then you will need to configure your certificates.
This is something you might do for any httpd instance and is mostly independent
of Koji

If you are using SSL authentication, then the CA certificate you configure
in ``SSLCACertificateFile`` here should be the same one that you use to issue
user certificates.

::

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/koji/certs/kojihub.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/koji/private/kojihub.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/pki/koji/koji_ca_cert.crt
    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/pki/koji/koji_ca_cert.crt


/etc/kojiweb/web.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to edit the kojiweb configuration file to tell kojiweb which URLs
it should use to access the hub, the koji packages and its own web interface.
You will also need to tell kojiweb where it can find the SSL certificates for
each of these components. If you are using SSL authentication, the "WebCert"
line below must contain both the public **and** private key. You will also want
to change the last line in the example below to a unique password. Also check
the file permissions (due to Secret value) if you're not installing koji web
from rpm (0640, root/apache by default).

Furthermore, you can install any config file in ``/etc/kojiweb/web.conf.d``
directory. These files are read *at first* and main config is allowed to
override all these values. So, you can use e.g.
``/etc/kojiweb/web.conf.d/secret.conf`` for sensitive values.

::

    [web]
    SiteName = koji
    # KojiTheme = 

    # Necessary urls
    KojiHubURL = https://koji-hub.example.com/kojihub
    KojiFilesURL = http://koji-filesystem.example.com/kojifiles

    ## Kerberos authentication options
    ; WebPrincipal = koji/web@EXAMPLE.COM
    ; WebKeytab = /etc/httpd.keytab
    ; WebCCache = /var/tmp/kojiweb.ccache

    ## SSL authentication options
    ; WebCert = /etc/pki/koji/koji-web.pem
    ; KojiHubCA = /etc/pki/koji/ca_cert.crt

    LoginTimeout = 72

    # This must be set before deployment
    #Secret = CHANGE_ME

    LibPath = /usr/share/koji-web/lib

Filesystem Configuration
------------------------

You'll need to make ``/mnt/koji/`` web-accessible, either here, on the hub, or
on another web server altogether.

This URL will go into various clients such as:
* ``/etc/kojiweb/web.conf`` as KojiFilesURL
* ``/etc/kojid/kojid.conf`` as topurl
* ``/etc/koji.conf`` as topurl

::

    Alias /kojifiles/ /mnt/koji/
    <Directory "/mnt/koji/">
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride None
        # Apache < 2.4
        #   Order allow,deny
        #   Allow from all
        # Apache >= 2.4
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

Wherever you configure this, please go back and set it correctly in
``/etc/kojiweb/web.conf`` now.

Web interface now operational
-----------------------------

At this point you should be able to point your web browser at the kojiweb URL
and be presented with the koji interface.  Many operations should work in read
only mode at this point, and any configured users should be able to log in.

Koji Daemon - Builder
=====================

Kojid is the build daemon that runs on each of the build machines. Its primary
responsibility is polling for incoming build requests and handling them
accordingly. Koji also has support for tasks other than building such as
creating livecd images or raw disk images, and kojid is responsible for
handling these tasks as well. The kojid service uses mock for creating pristine
build environments and creates a fresh one for every build, ensuring that
artifacts of build processes cannot contaminate each other. All of kojid is
written in Python and communicates with koji-hub via XML-RPC.

Configuration Files
-------------------

* ``/etc/kojid/kojid.conf`` - Koji Daemon Configuration
* ``/etc/sysconfig/kojid`` - Koji Daemon Switches
* ``/etc/mock/site-defaults.cfg`` - Mock's base configuration file

All options for `kojid.conf` are described :doc:`here <kojid_conf>`.

Mock-tuning options are described :doc:`here <mock_config>`.

Install kojid
-------------

Install the ``koji-builder`` package::

    # yum install koji-builder

Required Configuration
----------------------

Add the host entry for the koji builder to the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will now need to add the koji builder to the database so that they can be
utilized by koji hub. Make sure you do this before you start kojid for the
first time, or you'll need to manually remove entries from the sessions and
users table before it can be run successfully.

::

    kojiadmin@localhost$ koji add-host kojibuilder1.example.com i386 x86_64

The first argument used after the ``add-host`` command should the hostname of
the builder. The second argument is used to specify the architecture which the
builder uses.


/etc/kojid/kojid.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit each koji builder's ``kojid.conf`` file to point at the Koji hub::

    ; The URL for the xmlrpc server
    server=http://hub.example.com/kojihub

Set the "user" value to the FQDN of the builder host. For example, if you
added the host with ``koji add-host kojibuilder1.example.com``, set "user" to
kojibuilder1.example.com::

    user = kojibuilder1.example.com

The builder must reach the filesystem over HTTP. Set "topurl" to the same
value that you've configured for Koji clients (above)::

    # The URL for the file access
    topurl=http://koji-filesystem.example.com/kojifiles

If the "topurl" setting uses an HTTPS URL with a cert signed by a custom CA,
the Koji builder must trust the CA system-wide.

You may change "workdir", but it may not be the same as KojiDir on the
``kojihub.conf`` file. It can be something under KojiDir, just not the same as
KojiDir.

::

    ; The directory root for temporary storage
    workdir=/tmp/koji

The root of the koji build directory (i.e., ``/mnt/koji``) must be mounted on
the builder and configured as "topdir". A Read-Only NFS mount is the easiest
way to handle this.

::

    # The directory root where work data can be found from the koji hub
    topdir=/mnt/koji

Authentication Configuration (SSL certificates)
-----------------------------------------------

/etc/kojid/kojid.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using SSL, edit these settings to point to the
certificates you generated at the beginning of the setup process.

::

    ;client certificate
    ; This should reference the builder certificate we created on the kojihub CA, for kojibuilder1.example.com
    ; ALSO NOTE: This is the PEM file, NOT the crt
    cert = /etc/kojid/kojid.pem

    ;certificate of the CA that issued the HTTP server certificate
    serverca = /etc/kojid/koji_ca_cert.crt

Every unique builder host must have its own unique keypair (PEM file) in
``/etc/kojid/``. If you generated the certificates on another host, move them
to each builder.

Authentication Configuration (Kerberos)
---------------------------------------

/etc/kojid/kojid.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If using Kerberos, these settings need to be valid and inline with other
services configurations.

::

    ; the username has to be the same as what you used with add-host
    ;user =

    host_principal_format=compile/%s@EXAMPLE.COM

By default it will look for the Kerberos keytab in ``/etc/kojid/kojid.keytab``

.. note::
    Kojid will not attempt kerberos authentication to the koji-hub unless the
    username field is commented out

.. _scm-config:

Source Control Configuration
----------------------------

/etc/kojid/kojid.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *allowed_scms* setting controls which source control systems the builder
will accept. It is a space-separated list of entries in one of the following
forms:

::

    hostname:path[:use_common[:source_cmd]]
    !hostname:path

where

    *hostname* is a glob pattern matched against SCM hosts.

    *path* is a glob pattern matched against the SCM path.

    *use_common* is boolean setting (yes/no, on/off, true/false) that indicates
    whether koji should also check out /common from the SCM host. The default
    is on.

    *source_cmd* is a shell command to be run before building the
    srpm, with commas instead of spaces. It defaults to ``make,sources``.

The second form (``!hostname:path``) is used to explicitly block a host:path
pattern. In particular, it provides the option to block specific subtrees of
a host, but allow from it otherwise


::

    allowed_scms=
        !scm-server.example.com:/blocked/path/*
        scm-server.example.com:/repo/base/repos*/:no
        alt-server.example.com:/repo/dist/repos*/:no:fedpkg,sources


The explicit block syntax was added in version 1.13.0.

SCM checkout can contain multiple spec files (checkouted or created by
``source_cmd``). In such case spec file named same as a checkout directory will
be selected.

.. note::

    We provide ``build_from_scm`` hub policy as an equivalent in version
    1.26.0. It is a preffered way now as it a) allows centralized policy
    management without need to update all builders b) provides whole policy DSL
    and further information which can be used to determining the result.

    For more details, please refer to :ref:`allowed-scms` and
    :doc:`Defining Hub Policies <defining_hub_policies>`.

Add the host to the createrepo channel
--------------------------------------

Channels are a way to control which builders process which tasks.  By default
hosts are added to the ''default'' channel.  At least some build hosts also
needs to be added to the ''createrepo'' channel so there will be someone to
process repo creation tasks initiated by kojira.

::

    kojiadmin@localhost$ koji add-host-to-channel kojibuilder1.example.com createrepo

A note on capacity
------------------

The default capacity of a host added to the host database is 2. This means that
once the load average on that machine exceeds 2, kojid will not accept any
additional tasks. This is separate from the maxjobs item in the configuration
file. Before kojid will accept a job, it must pass both the test to ensure the
load average is below capacity and that the current number of jobs it is
already processing is less than maxjobs. However, in today's modern age of quad
core and higher CPUs, a load average of 2 is generally insufficient to fully
utilize hardware.

::

    koji edit-host --capacity=16 kojibuilder1.example.com

The koji-web interface also offers the ability to edit this value to admin
accounts.

Start Kojid
-----------

Once the builder has been added to the database you must start kojid

::

    root@localhost$ systemctl enable kojid --now

Check ``/var/log/kojid.log`` to verify that kojid has started successfully. If
the log does not show any errors then the koji builder should be up and ready.
You can check this by pointing your web browser to the web interface and
clicking on the hosts tab. This will show you a list of builders in the
database and the status of each builder.

Kojira - Dnf|Yum repository creation and maintenance
====================================================

Configuration Files
-------------------

* ``/etc/kojira/kojira.conf`` - Kojira Daemon Configuration

Install kojira
---------------

Install the ``koji-utils`` package::

    # yum install koji-utils

Required Configuration
----------------------

Add the user entry for the kojira user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The kojira user requires the ``repo`` permission to function.

::

    kojiadmin@localhost$ koji add-user kojira
    kojiadmin@localhost$ koji grant-permission repo kojira

``/etc/kojira/kojira.conf``
    This needs to point at your koji-hub.

    ::

        ; The URL for the xmlrpc server
        server=http://koji-hub.example.com/kojihub


Additional Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Kojira needs read-write access to ``/mnt/koji``.
* There should only be one instance of kojira running at any given time.
* It is not recommended that kojira run on the builders, as builders only
  should require read-only access to ``/mnt/koji``.


.. _auth-config:

Authentication Configuration
----------------------------

/etc/kojira/kojira.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**If using SSL,** these settings need to be valid.

::

    ;client certificate
    ; This should reference the kojira certificate we created above
    cert = /etc/pki/koji/kojira.pem

    ;certificate of the CA that issued the HTTP server certificate
    serverca = /etc/pki/koji/koji_ca_cert.crt

**If using Kerberos,** these settings need to be valid.

::

    ;configuration for Kerberos authentication

    ;the kerberos principal to use
    ;principal = kojira@EXAMPLE.COM

    ;location of the keytab
    ;keytab = /etc/kojira/kojira.keytab

``/etc/sysconfig/kojira``
    The local user kojira runs as needs to be able to read and write to
    ``/mnt/koji/repos/``. If the volume that directory resides on is
    root-squashed or otherwise unmodifiable by root, you can set ``RUNAS=`` to
    a user that has the required privileges.

Start Kojira
------------

::

    root@localhost$ service kojira start

Check ``/var/log/kojira/kojira.log`` to verify that kojira has started
successfully.

Bootstrapping the Koji build environment
========================================

For instructions on importing packages and preparing Koji to run builds, see
:doc:`Server Bootstrap <server_bootstrap>`.

For instructions on using External Repos and preparing Koji to run builds, see
